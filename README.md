# Ruhama+ 

you may now take a real good look at some of what may genuinely be the worst code i've ever written

don't even remember the main use of this client... who cares anyway i guess

it's exactly what the title says it is... i took ruhama (a mid - late 2019 32k client) and expanded on it. contains a lot of useless garbage


(1.12.2, it's old)

oh yeah and half the shit here doesn't work and none of it is marked as so have fun :trollface:
